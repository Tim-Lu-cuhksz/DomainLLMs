# DomainLLMs
Domain large language models exhibit better performance compared to the general ones. However, when asking questions that are out of the domain, they may perform in a bad and unreliable way. 

Our goal is to analyze the OOD generalizability of domain LLMs and propose ways to improve the SOTA OOD detection methods for LLMs.
